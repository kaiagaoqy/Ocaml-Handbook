## 1. Encoding
Because of limitedly accessible features in Fb, we do computations using **encoding**.

```
Encodings are transformations of all instances in a expression on source code to supported formats before evaluating it.
```

- This transformation is not evaluation but a modification of the **AST** like substitute
- So, transformation only expresses a feature in one language but not guarantees its efficiency.

For example: 
Fb has no multiplication, but we could **encode multiplication with repeated addition**. Doing so would give us the ability to express multiplication, but it run much more slowly than if our language supported multiplication directly and our interpreter could use the multiplication circuitry in our hardware to compute efficiently

## 2. Let
Just a more convenient for us to write, but is as expressive as functions.
$$Let\ x = e_1\ in\ e_2 =^{def} (Fun\ x \rightarrow e_2)\ e_1$$


## 2. Pair
There are many possible encodings for pair
### 2.1 use functions to express pair
```ocaml
let get_left = "Let p = Fun d -> d 3 2 In
				p (Fun x -> Fun y -> x)"
------------------------------------
utop # peu get_left;;
- : string = "3"
```
- `Fun d -> d 3 2`:  Substitute d for a function then take 3 and 2 as two arguments
- `p (Fun x -> Fun y -> x)` : Use curring to express multi-parameter functions ->  `(Fun x -> Fun y -> x) 3 2 = (Fun y -> x) 2 [3/x] = (Fun y->3) 2 = (3) [y/2] = 3`

### 2.2 Fb's curring or Ocaml's let?
We can generalize `get_left` into
```ocaml
let pr l r = "(Let lft = ("^l^") In Let rgt = ("^r^") In
			Fun x -> x lft rgt)";;
			
(* Macros for extracting contents of pairs *)

let left c = "Let p = "^c^" In p (Fun x -> Fun y -> x)";;

let right c = "Let p = "^c^" In p (Fun x -> Fun y -> y)";;
-----------------------------------
utop # peu(pr "3+2" "2");;
- : string = "Function x -> x 5 2"

utop # peu (left (pr "3+2" "2"));;
- : string = "5"
----------------------------------
(* Or we could made pr a 2-argument Fb function*)
let pr_fb = "(Fun lft -> Fun rgt -> Fun x -> x lft rgt)";;
let pr_fb_eg = pr_fb ^ "(4+2) 5";;
----------------------------------
utop # peu pr_fb_eg;;
- : string = "Function x -> x 6 5"
```
- `^`: Use `^` to concat strings
- Here we use `let` instead of function to force order of computation
- **We need parens around all macro parameters like the `l` and `r`  to not change the parse order**
	- A more specific examples about the importance of parens is as below:

``` ocaml
let double n = "(" ^ n ^ ") + (" ^ n ^ ")";; (* n is a _macro parameter_, a string *)
double "2 + 4";; (* "(2 + 4) + (2 + 4)" *)

(* peu(double "2+4") ==> "12" *)

(*

* Why didn't we just write n ^"+" ^ n above?? We need parens around all

macro parameters like the n to not change the parse order.

* This is the downside of working over concrete syntax as strings

* Notice also that macros do not do any evaluation -- `2 + 4` not `6` in the above.

If we omit the two parens, then the prder would change from (2+4)+(2+4) to 2+4+2+4,

*)

(* Example of a bad string-based macro *)

let apply_bad f x = f^" "^x;; (* sort of looks OK here for f x ... *)

let apply_bad_eg = apply_bad "Fun x -> x" "0";; (* oops! this is string "Fun x -> x 0" which is "Fun x -> (x 0)" *)

  

(* Fixed version - parens around each macro parameter *)

let apply f x = "("^f^")("^x^")";;

let apply_eg = apply "Fun x ->x" "0";; (* "(Fun x ->x)(0)", parsing is correct! *)
```



### 2.3 Usage for pair -> pair_add
High level idea is Fun p -> left p + right p
``` ocaml
let pc = pr "34+3" "45";; (* peu pc is "Fun x -> x 37 45" -- the eager pair that we wanted *)

(* A use of pairs: an Fb function which takes a pair, adds up components

High level idea is Fun p -> left p + right p, add ^'s and ()'s

Since pair encoding is via macros you need to escape to OCaml to use them *)

  

let pair_add = "Fun p -> ("^ left "p" ^ ") + (" ^ right "p" ^ ")";;

let use_pair_add = "(" ^ pair_add ^ ")(" ^ pc ^ ")";;

```
