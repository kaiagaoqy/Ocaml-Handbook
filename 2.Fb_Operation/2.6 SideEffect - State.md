Make sure you pass/return the **most recent version**
### Review
``` ocaml
(* Functional trace in OCaml*)
Let t0 = Leaf in         [Thread the newest version along]
let t1 = add(5,t0) in    [Each time you give it a new name, it becomes a new list]
let t2 = add(6,t1) in
...
...
in lookup(7,tk)
```

### State
Idea: encode state threading as a global program transformation ( Not a macro! because macros are local)
#### Motivation

```start-multi-column
ID: ID_cm3r
Number of Columns: 2
Largest Column: standard
```

## Ocaml
``` ocaml
let r = ref 0 in 
let f = fun _ -> r := !r + 1 in
f 0


---> r = 1  at the end
```

--- column-end ---
## Encoding
Every value is now a pair`(value, heap)`
``` ocaml
let (_,r) = (arg,0) in 
let f = fun(_,r) -> (_,r+1) in 
f (0,r)
```

=== end-multi-column

#### Math for FbS
Every time we have a value or and expression, we now have a pair, and we are going to thread s everywhere.
Now we have an extra data structure to represent what the stage is.
	- The `S` (store) here is the same as the heap we have mentioned above.
	- $S_0$ represents the initially empty state, where $S$ is the final store when computation terminates.
$$Replace\quad e\Rightarrow v \quad With \quad <e,S_0>\Rightarrow <v,S>\quad\ and\ thread\ s\ through$$
##### Operational Semantics for FbS
$$e::=(*\ insert\ all\ Fb\ rules\ here\ *)| !e|e:=v|Ref\ e$$
$$v::=(*\ insert\ all\ Fb\ rules\ here\ *)|c$$
