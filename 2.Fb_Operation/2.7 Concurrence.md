Concurrence = concurrent computation
Parallelism = concurrency + actions at exact the same time

## Models of Concurrency on modern computers
### 1. classic languages: C, C++, Java apps
- Multi-threading(Its own stack & code pointer)
- Shared memory
- Preemptive: Thread gets a time slice, another waiting thread can swap in when 
#### Two horrendous problems in multi-threading
1. shared memory leads to potential conflicts: deadlock, live lock, races...


#### Why are concurrent bugs so bad?
- Many different ways for thread to interleave
- Too many to test all
- Most hard bugs tend to be concurrency problems

### 2. Improved models for concurrent programming
#### Go Routines: NO shared memory between threads




## The Actor model of concurrency
Use: AFbV
### Principles of actors
- Individual actors are objects like
		- actor = code + data
		- named, put in variables
		- self-aware
- **Actors process "messages" in parallel**, not by concurrent behavior of an individual actor
	- If an actor is busy when a message arrives is it put in a message queue – only one message is processed at a time by an actor. 
	- Can send 0 or more messages to any number of actors
	- Actors have internal states (not exactly like objects)
- **All messaging is asynchronous** – sending actors never wait for a reply from the receiving actor.
	- **Messages stored in soup rather than a queue**: The arrival order of the messages is nondeterministic, they may arrive in a different order they were sent in. (Like UDP)
- Each actor "owns" all of its memory(No shared memory) --> avoid memory contention
	- all communication between actors is via explicit messaging, not by implicit communication through a shared variable in a common memory.
	- Along with their local computation actions and sending of messages, **actors can create other actors.** (like `new` in O-O programming)
- State of actor over time:
	1. idle
	2. gets a message in
	3. wakes up and process QUICKLY
	4. becomes new state then back to idle
- Read/write is very restrictive
	- receive ONE message at waking (1.)
	- receive NO message in 2. above
	- can send arbitrary message in 2.
- Downside: Have to break things up into yields to program it

- Actor states: a funky notion of state
	- no fields
	- AFbV has no mutation
		- functional for one message
	-  At the end of every message processing, define state for the next message

- Two steppings
	- one local actor  $$e \Rightarrow^S v, where\ e=actor+msg, v=code\ for\ next\ actor, S=new\ things\ in\ soup$$
	- global soup stepping: Only one actor at a time but can do in parallel $$G_1 \rightarrow G_2$$

(* To close the loop, here is actual code for something like the a1/a2 example we worked in class.  
   Recall the way it went:

   1) in the bootstrap code we created actors a1 and a2 and send a1 the message `hi(7)
   2) a1 handled the `hi(7) message, sending `ho(0) to a2
   3) a2 then replied `ok(0) to a1.

   Note that both a1 and a2 need to know each others' addresses; we can't in fact do that in the syntax
   of AFbV (it is a mutual self-reference) - !  So, here we do a minor variation where the bootstrap code
   makes a1 and send the `hi(7) message, and a1 then BOTH creates a2 and sends it a `ho(0) message.

## Syntax of AFbV
$$v::=\dots FbV \ values\dots | a$$
- a: actor address/ pointer
$$e::=\dots FbV expressions\dots|e\leftarrow e'|Create(e,e')|a$$
- $e\leftarrow e'$: e = actor's name/pointer, e' = Send the value of e' to e
- $Create(e,e')$: e = actor's behavior, e' = initial local state

## Operational Semantics of Actors
#### The global stepping of all actors
A global state G is a “soup” of the active actors and sent messages
$$G\cup\{<a,v>,[a\leftarrow v]\}\rightarrow
G\cup \{<a,v_{new}>\}\cup S, if\ v_{function}\cup v_{v_{msg}}\Rightarrow^{S}v_{new}$$

- S is a set of $<a_i,v_i>$ (new actors created) and $[a_j\leftarrow v_j]$ (new messages), in fact, S are side effects
- In each single step, only **ONE** actor in the soup completely processes **ONE** message in the soup

Actor systems can run forever (or no more synchronizations )with small steps of computation: $$G_!\rightarrow G_2 \rightarrow\dots$$
- $G_1$ is the bootstrap state

#### The local computation within an actor
Bubbling down the aside 

- Let: $$ \frac{e_1\Rightarrow^{S_1}V_1\quad e_2[v_1/x]\Rightarrow^{S_2}V}{Let\ x=e_1\ In\ e_2 \Rightarrow^{S_1\cup S_2}V}$$

### Continuation Passing Style(cps) -> make continuation a parameter to pass
- Continuation: the rest of the code (what to continue with)
- With the continuation, we need no returns and just pass this down
##### Example: 
- NOT CPS: 
$$Let\ double = Fun\ x\rightarrow x+x\ In\ (double\ 5) + 21$$
	- `+21` is the continuation of the double 5 call, but it is not passed in as a parameter
- CPS:
		$$Let\ double = Fun\ x\rightarrow Fun\ c \rightarrow c(x+x)\ In\ double\ 5\ (Fun\ res\rightarrow res + 21)$$
	- No need to return double 5 in the continuation with an extra parameter
	- Package up the continuation as a function
- Actor version
```ocaml
(* Internal state example: count_down_behavior where the actor internally keeps the count

Actors can be stateful in this manner: stateless during message processing but

stateful between each message.

State is really just a parameter passed to the continuation each time, hand over fist. *)

let internal_count = "Let y = (Fun b -> Let w = Fun s -> Fun m -> b (s s) m In w w) In

Let self_messaging_behavior =

  

(* Observe how here the 'cur_count' state parameter is now under the Y - it is not just a global parameter,

each recursion also needs to be fed cur_count, and that will allow us to propagate state *)

Fun me -> y (Fun this -> Fun cur_count -> Fun msg ->

Match msg With

`count(_) ->

(Print \"OUTPUT: \"; (Print cur_count); Print \"\n\");

(If cur_count = 0 Then 0 Else (me <- (`count (00))));

(this (cur_count-1)))

In

Let actor = Create(self_messaging_behavior, 4) In

actor <- `count (00)"

;;
```

The two key lines are 
```ocaml
(If cur_count = 0 Then 0 Else (me <- (`count (00))));

(this (cur_count-1)))
```

- If cur_count = 0 Then done
- Else send new message to itself and tell the code to process next: pass `this` (the actor itself) and `cur_count-1` (local data --> state) in as parameters of Y combinator
