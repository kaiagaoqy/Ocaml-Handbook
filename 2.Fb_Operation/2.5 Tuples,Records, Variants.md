#### Syntax
$$e::= (Fb \ clauses)|n(e)$$
where $n(e)$ always have payload(0 for none) to ease the manipulation
$$n::=`<String>$$
The back-tick(\`) means you don't have to declare a type for them
``` ocaml
utop # `Some(5);;
- : [> `Some of int ] = `Some 5

utop # `Hello;;
- : [> `Hello ] = `Hello
```
