## 2. Records(FbR)
#### Define

## 3. Variants(FbV)
### Syntax
$$e::= (Fb \ clauses)|n(e)$$
where $n(e)$ always have payload(0 for none) to ease the manipulation
$$n::=`<String>$$
The back-tick(\`) means you don't have to declare a type for them
``` ocaml
utop # `Some(5);;
- : [> `Some of int ] = `Some 5

utop # `Hello;;
- : [> `Hello ] = `Hello
```

#### Example
To show how it works in OCaml, I lowercase every keyword to fit them in OCaml. Remember to uppercase them in Fb
```ocaml
utop # let v = `Some(3+2) in 
match v with 
|`Some(x) -> x-1
|`None(_) -> 0;; 
- : int = 4
```

Let's figure out how it works
1. $`Some(3+2) -> `Some(5)$: Keep in mind that Fb follows call-by-value strategy, which means expressions are evaluated and their values bound to variables, no matter if this variable is ever needed to complete execution. Languages whose evaluation is call-by-value are also called *eager*.
2. Plug $`Some(5)$ in to substitute  `v` for  $`Some(5)$
3. Match with clauses
4. Match the payload: $(x-1)[5/x]$
5. Output the evaluation: $5-1 = 4$

### FbV rules

$$
\begin{align}
Fb &\ rules \\
&\& \\
\end{align}
$$
$$\frac{e \Rightarrow v}{n(e)\Rightarrow n(v)}$$

$$

\frac{e \Rightarrow n(v)\quad n=n_i, i\leq k \quad e_i[v/x_i]\Rightarrow v'}{
\begin{align}Match\ &e\ With \\
&|n_1(x_1) \rightarrow e_1 \\
&|\dots\\
&|n_k(x_k) \rightarrow e_k\\
\end{align}
\Rightarrow v'
}
\quad,where\ k \geq 1

$$

## 4. And & Or data
``` ad-important
Fact: Objects can be represented as both *and-data* (records) and *or-data* (variants)
```
