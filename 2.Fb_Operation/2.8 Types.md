## Typed & Untyped
```
Type: Property annotated before runtime --> Offer more info at compile-time --> faster

```
- (Static) Types
	- types checked at **Compile Time**
	- Java, OCaml, C/C++
- Dynamic Types
	- types checked at **Run time**
	- Fb, Python, JavaScript
- Untyped
	- No checking
	- Assembly language

##### Examples:
- Array indexing `a[-22]`
	- Java: Dynamically typed --> Run Time err
		- Note that the type of an array (i.e. int, float) is statically checked, but the size is dynamically checked.
	- C/C++: Untyped
	- dynamic type checking that occurs in statically typed languages
- Casting `(Class A)Class B --> (int)float`
	- Java: downcast --> dynamically typed `(float)int`
	- Java: upcast --> statically typed `(super)child`
- Divided by 0 `int->int(non-zero)->int`
	- Dynamically typed

##### Pros and Cons of Types
- +: Help debugging
	- errs happen much sooner than always
	- type-directed programming: program to types 
- +: Types serve as lightweight specification
- +: Typed language will run much faster
- -: Can't whip up ad-hoc code which is concise but not typed
		- eg avoiding some/Not in Python

## Type system
Goal: type soundness: if `e` (expression/program) is well-typed, then `e` never gets stuck
##### Well Typed -> TFb
###### Syntax
$$e::\dots Fb -Let,-Let Rec-Fun|Fun\ x:\tau \rightarrow e$$
$$\tau ::=Int|Bool|\tau\rightarrow \tau$$
- $\tau$: type of x
- type constructor -> :  represent the type of the entire function expression.

- **(Type Environment)** :A type environment, Γ, is a set {x1 : τ1, . . . , xn : τn} of bindings of free variables types. If a variable x is listed twice in Γ, the rightmost (innermost) binding is the proper type.
$$\Gamma(x)=\tau \Rightarrow \tau\ is\ the\ innermost\ type\ for\ x\ in\ \Gamma $$
-  **(Type Assertion)**:  A type assertion, 
- $$\Gamma\ e : \tau \Rightarrow in\ type\ environment\ \Gamma, e\ is\ of\ type\ \tau $$
